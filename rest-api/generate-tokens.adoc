A refresh token is used to programmatically obtain a new set of access tokens and is good for one week or until it has been used to obtain a new set of tokens.

Steps to generate a refresh token using the Digital Advisor portal are as follows:

. Log in to the https://aiq.netapp.com/api[Digital Advisor portal] using NetApp credentials and select *Generate Tokens*.

+
NOTE: For first-time users, if *Generate Tokens* option is not available, select *Register* to submit an authorization request. Fill out the registration form to enable the functionality.
+
. The system generates an access token and a refresh token. Save the refresh token on a trusted platform. 
+
NOTE: The portal gives you multiple ways to save one or both tokens in the set. You can copy them to clipboard, download them as a text file, or view them as plain text.
