This section lists the components required to enable NetApp Keystone STaaS services in your environment.

== Site requirements
There are some site-specific requirements, such as space, racks, PDUs, power, and cooling, with additional network and security requirements discussed here.

=== Space
Floor space to host the Keystone infrastructure equipment (to be provided by customers). NetApp provides the weight specifications based on the final configuration.

=== Racks
Four post racks in the customer-operated offering (to be provided by customers). In the NetApp-operated offering, either NetApp or the customer can provide the racks, depending on requirements. NetApp provides 42 deep racks.

=== PDUs
You should provide the power distribution units (PDUs), connected to two separate, protected circuits with sufficient C13 outlets. In the customer-operated offering, in some cases, C19 outlets are required. In the NetApp-operated offering, either NetApp or the customer can provide the PDUs, depending on requirements.

=== Power
You should provide the required power. NetApp will provide the power requirement specifications based on 200V rating (Typical A, Max A, Typical W, Max W, Power cord type, and quantity), based on the final configuration. All components have redundant power supplies. NetApp will provide the in-cabinet power cords.

=== Cooling
NetApp can provide the cooling requirement specifications (Typical BTU, Max BTU), based on the final configuration and requirement.

=== Storage virtual machines
Storage virtual machines (storage VMs) should be deployed with the following to support the monitoring and metering of Keystone subscriptions. One storage VM is required for theKeystone Collector; another is required for the OpsRamp Gateway

* Keystone Collector- Used to collect usage metrics:
**	vCPU: 4
**	vRAM: 16 GB
**	vDisk: 200 GB
* OpsRamp Gateway â€“ Used to real time monitor + remote support ONTAP by Keystone GSSC:
**	vCPU: 8 
**	vRAM: 16 GB
**	vDisk: 100 GB

=== Deployment Options
The Keystone Collector can be deployed through the following methods:

*	VMware OVA template (VMware vCenter Server 6.7 or later is required)
*	Customer provides Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or 8 or CentOS 7 Linux server, and Keystone software is installed via `.rpm` installation process.

OpsRamp Gateway is deployed on the following configuration:

*	VMware OVA template (VMware vCenter Server 6.7 or later is required)
*	Bootable .iso installer for 
**	Citrix XenServer
**	Microsoft Hyper-V
**	Kernel-based Virtual Machine (Linux KVM)

=== Networking 
Outbound access is required to the following services for operations and maintenance of the Keystone Collector and OpsRamp Gateway:

*	support.netapp.com (usage data upload)
*	keystone.netapp.com (software  updates)
*	Hub.Docker.io (software updates)

Depending on customer requirements and the storage controllers used, NetApp can provide 10 GB, 40 GB, and 100 GB connectivity at the customer's site.

NetApp provides the required transceivers for NetApp-provided infrastructure devices only. You should supply transceivers required for customer devices and cabling to the NetApp-provided Keystone infrastructure devices.

== Remote access requirement
Network connectivity is required between the storage infrastructure installed at the customer data center or customer owned co-located services, and Keystone operations center. The customer is responsible for providing the compute and virtual machines, and the internet services. The network design should be over a secured protocol and firewall policies will be approved by both NetApp and customers.

NetApp needs to access the hardware and software components installed for monitoring and management to provide services such as monitoring and billing to Keystone customers. The most common method is to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection to the customer network and access the required data. To overcome any operational complexity perceived by customers to arise from opening firewall ports to new services, the monitoring tools initiate an external connection. NetApp cloud applications, such as OpsRamp and Zuora, use this connection to perform the respective services. This method meets the customer requirement of not opening firewall ports though providing access to the monitoring components that are part of this service.
