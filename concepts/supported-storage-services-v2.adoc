[.lead]
Keystone STaaS services for version 2 (v2) support file and block storage with ONTAP, object storage with StorageGRID, and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

Keystone STaaS provides standard and optional services for your storage. 

*Keystone STaaS standard services*: Standard services are included within the base subscription and are not charged separately.

*Keystone STaaS add-on services*: These are optional, chargeable services that provide additional utilities and benefits on top of standard Keystone STaaS subscription services.

Keystone STaaS services can be used at the same time. For example, a cloud storage subscription can have the same term as with file, block, and object storage subscriptions. A cloud service can be included at any point during the service term of an existing storage subscription. However, if you do not plan to renew an existing file, block, and object subscription, a cloud storage subscription cannot be added during the last 90 days of the subscription.
