Keystone STaaS offers you the option to allocate a portion of your designated expenses towards the subscribed file, block, or object storage service levels to hybrid cloud storage services. 

This functionality is available on the Extreme, Premium, Performance, Standard, Value, Data Tiering, and Object service levels for your on-premises storage services. Up to 25% of the Annual Contract Value (ACV) could be reallocated at a quarterly basis to Cloud Volumes ONTAP Primary and Cloud Volumes ONTAP Secondary service:

The following table provides a set of sample values to demonstrate how the reallocation of expenses works. In this example, `$5000` from the monthly spend is to be reallocated to hybrid cloud storage services.


|===
|*Before allocation* | *Capacity (TiB)* |*Monthly designated expense* 
| Extreme |125 | 37,376 
|*After reallocation* | *Capacity (TiB)* |*Monthly designated expense* 
| Extreme |108 | 37,376 
| Cloud Volumes ONTAP |47 | 5,000 
|||37,376 

|===

[NOTE]
Reducing the capacity allocated for the Extreme service level from 125 TiB to 108 TiB is a reduction by 17 TiB. On spend reallocation, the allotted hybrid cloud storage capacity is not of 17 TiB but an equivalent cloud storage that $5000 can purchase. An amount of $5000 can purchase 17 TiB on-prem storage capacity for the Extreme service level and 47 TiB hybrid cloud capacity of Cloud Volumes ONTAP service level. Therefore, the reallocation is with respect to the spend, not capacity.

Contact your Keystone Success Manager (KSM) if you want to reallocate expenses from your on-premises services to cloud services.
