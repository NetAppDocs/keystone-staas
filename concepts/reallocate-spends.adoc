Keystone STaaS offers you the option to reallocate on-premises service spend to Cloud Volumes ONTAP spend.

You can allocate a portion of your expenses towards your subscribed file, block, or object storage service levels to hybrid cloud storage services. Up to 25% of the Annual Contract Value (ACV) can be reallocated on a quarterly basis to Cloud Volumes ONTAP Primary and Cloud Volumes ONTAP Secondary services:

This table provides a set of sample values to demonstrate how the reallocation of expenses works. In this example, `$5000` from the monthly spend is reallocated to hybrid cloud storage service.


|===
|*Before allocation* | *Capacity (TiB)* |*Monthly designated expense* 
| Extreme |125 | 37,376 
|*After reallocation* | *Capacity (TiB)* |*Monthly designated expense* 
| Extreme |108 | 37,376 
| Cloud Volumes ONTAP |47 | 5,000 
|||37,376 

|===

The reduction is of (125-108) = 17 TiB of the capacity allocated for the Extreme service level. On spend reallocation, the allotted hybrid cloud storage is not of 17 TiB but an equivalent capacity that $5000 can purchase. In this example, for $5000, you can get 17 TiB on-prem storage capacity for the Extreme service level and 47 TiB hybrid cloud capacity of Cloud Volumes ONTAP service level. Therefore, the reallocation is with respect to the spend, not capacity.

Contact your Keystone Success Manager (KSM) if you want to reallocate expenses from your on-premises services to cloud services.
