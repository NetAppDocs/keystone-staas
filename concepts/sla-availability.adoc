[.lead]
NetApp Keystone offers Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for availability, performance, and sustainability to ensure superior STaaS offerings. Availability SLA targets an uptime of 99.999% during a billing period for all deployed ##NetApp AFF storage arrays## for the Keystone order. 

== Metrics
The following are the key metrics:

* *Monthly uptime percentage* = [(total eligible seconds in a month - average of total downtime seconds of all deployed AFF storage arrays) / total eligible seconds in a month] x 100%
* *Downtime*: The period of time when both controllers in a pair within a storage array are not available, as determined by NetApp.
* *Eligible seconds*: These are the seconds in a month that count towards the uptime calculation. It does not include the time period when the STaaS services are not available because of planned maintenance, upgrades, support activities agreed upon with NetApp, or due to circumstances that are beyond control or responsibility of NetApp or Keystone services.

== Service levels
The service levels for the ##NetApp AFF storage platform## are eligible for availability SLA. To learn more, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/keystone-staas/concepts/service-levels.html#service-levels-for-file-and-block-storage[Service levels in Keystone].

== Service credits
If the availability of ##NetApp AFF storage arrays## for eligible subscriptions falls below the 99.999% monthly uptime target within a billing period, NetApp issues service credits as follow:

|===
|*Monthly availability (less than)* |*Service credit*

a|99.999%
a|5%

a|99.99%
a|10%

a|99.9%
a|25%

a|99.0%
a|50%

|===

== Service credit calculation
The service credit is determined using the following formula:

Service credit = (impacted capacity / total committed capacity) X capacity fees X service credit

Where:

* *impacted capacity*: The amount of stored capacity affected.
* *total committed capacity*: The committed capacity for the service level for the Keystone order.
* *capacity fees*: The fees for the affected service level for the month.
* *credit percentage*: The predetermined percentage for service credit.

*Example*

The following example shows the method of calculation for service credit:

|===
|*Service level*|*Impacted capacity*|*Total committed capacity*|*Capacity fees*|*Credit percentage*
a|Extreme| 10 Tib | 100 Tib | $1000 | 5%
|===

Using the formula:
Service credit = ( 10 / 100 ) X 1000 x 0.05

Based on calculation, the service credit will be $5.

== Service credit request
If a breach of the SLA is detected, a service credit request can be initiated within six weeks of the validation of the event. All service credits should be acknowledged and approved by NetApp. 

To request service credits, follow these steps:

. Open a priority 3 (P3) support ticket with Keystone Global Services and Support Center (GSSC). The following details are required:
.. Keystone subscription number
.. Volumes and storage controller details 
.. Site, time, date, and description of the issue 
.. Calculated time duration of latency detection
.. Measurement tools and methods
.. Any other applicable document
. Provide the details in the excel sheet as shown below for a P3 ticket opened with Keystone GSSC.
