NetApp offers Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for ensuring continuous uptime of your systems governed by Keystone STaaS. Availability SLA ensures to provide at least 99.999% average uptime during a billing period across all NetApp AFF storage arrays for your Keystone StaaS subscriptions.

The failover events are calculated 15 seconds after the failover till the HA failover is complete, after which it is considered as a system downtime. The capacity affected during the downtime is also measured, in terms of the affected nodes and volumes, and on an SLA breach credits would be calculated and issues proportionately based on the committed capacity of the respective service level. 


== Service levels of availability SLA
The service levels for NetApp AFF Storage platform are eligible for availability SLA. This includes the service levels for file and block storage, that is Extreme, Performance, Premium, and Standard service levels. 

For information about service levels, see link:../concepts/service-levels.html[Service Levels in Keystone].

== Availability metrics
The metrics for availability and uptime SLA is considered 

monthly uptime percentage = [(maximum available minutes â€“ downtime) / maximum available minutes] x 100%
maximum available minutes = total number of minutes in a billing period
downtime = the period of time during which both controllers, within an HA pair of a Storage Array, are unavailable, as determined by NetApp, excluding a period of time when the Subscription Services are not available due to scheduled or mutually agreed upon time period for NetApp to perform maintenance, upgrades, or support activities, or due to situations outside of NetApp or Keystone Service control or responsibilities.
