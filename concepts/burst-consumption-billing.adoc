NetApp Keystone (Keystone) billing is based on burst capacity.

Burst capacity

When the consumed capacity is greater than the committed capacity for a given Performance Service Level, burst consumption is recorded, and charges are applied accordingly. This process occurs for each consumption record generated. Burst consumption, therefore, is a reflection of both the amount and tenure of your over-consumed capacities on top of your committed capacities.
