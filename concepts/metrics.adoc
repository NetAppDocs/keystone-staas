The NetApp Keystone STaaS service uses several terms to measure metrics. You might want to learn more about these terms as you use Keystone for version 3 (v3).

The following terms and definitions are used within the Keystone STaaS service to measure metrics:

* Capacity measurement units: GiB, TiB, and PiB
* IOPS: Number of input/output operations processed per second.
* Service availability
* Durability in accurate data access
* Latency and speed

== Metrics measurement

* *Capacity measurement in gibibyte (GiB), tebibyte (TiB), and pebibyte (PiB)*: Measurements of data storage capacity using base of 1024 (1 GiB = 1024^3^ bytes, 1 TiB = 1024^4^ bytes, and 1PiB = 1024^5^ bytes).
* *Operations counter chart in IOPS*: The protocol operations per second, requested by the application.
* *Availability*: Measured as a percentage of the number of I/O requests successfully responded to by the service, divided by total number of I/O requests made to the service. This is measured at the service demarcation in a month and does not include the scheduled service downtime or unavailability of the facilities, network, or other services provided by the customer.
* *Durability*: Percentage of data accessed without loss of fidelity, excluding customer-caused deletion or corruption.
* *Latency*: Time to service an I/O request received from a client, measured at the service demarcation (storage controller I/O port).

=== Performance metrics
The following performance metrics are applicable for unified and block-optimized services:

*Unified services:*

* *IOPS*: For ONTAP 9.16.1 with NFS, each performance level instance supports random access with a 70% read and 30% write ratio, an 8 KB block size, and a latency of 1 ms (4 ms for Standard).
* *Throughput*: For ONTAP 9.16.1 with NFS, each performance level instance supports sequential access with 100% read and a 32 KB block size.

*Block optimized services:*

* *IOPS*: For ONTAP 9.16.1 with FCP, each performance level instance supports random access with a 70% read and 30% write ratio, an 8 KB block size, and a latency of 1 ms.
* *Throughput*: For ONTAP 9.16.1 with FCP, each performance level instance supports sequential access with 100% read and a 64 KB block size.
