NetApp Keystone STaaS offers two operational models for service delivery: partner-operated model and customer-operated model. You should understand these options before you get started with Keystone.

* *Partner-operated model*: This model offers two options:
+
** *Service provider*: A service provider operates the services for their end customers. As the contracted party with NetApp, the service provider manages a multi-tenant environment where each tenant, who is a customer of the service provider, has their own subscription, billed by the service provider. The service provider administrator is responsible for performing all administrative tasks for the tenants.
** *Reseller*: As a reseller, a partner acts as a bridge between NetApp and the customer. The partner sells Keystone services to the end customer and manages the invoicing. While the partner takes care of billing, NetApp provides direct support to the customer. Keystone support interacts with the customer and handles all administrative tasks for the tenants.
* *Customer-operated model*: As a customer, you can subscribe to Keystone services according to your selected performance service levels and storage. NetApp defines the architecture and products, and deploys Keystone at your premises. You need to manage the infrastructure through your storage and IT resources. Based on your contract, you can raise service requests to be addressed by NetApp or your service provider. An administrator from your organization can perform the administrative tasks at your site (environment). These tasks are associated with the users in your environment.

== Roles and responsibilities across the service lifecycle

* *Partner-operated model*: The share of roles and responsibilities depends on the agreement between you and the service provider or partner. Contact your service provider for information.
* *Customer-operated model*: The following table summarizes the overall service lifecycle model and the roles and responsibilities associated with them in a customer-operated environment.
