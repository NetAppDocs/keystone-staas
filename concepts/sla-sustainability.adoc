[.lead]
NetApp Keystone delivers a guaranteed measurement of maximum number of actual watts per tebibyte (W/TiB) for storage services based on ONTAP flash storage arrays with Sustainability SLA. Sustainability SLA defines the maximum consumption of W/TiB for each eligible service level, helping organizations meet their sustainability goals.

== Metrics

* *Watts*: The power consumption reported from daily AutoSupport, including the usage by the controller and attached disk shelves. 
* *Tebibyte*: The maximum of:
** the committed capacity + allocated burst capacity for the service level, or
** the effective deployed capacity, assuming a storage efficiency factor of `2:1`. 

+
To learn more about storage efficiency ratio, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/task_analyze_storage_efficiency.html[Analyze capacity and storage efficiency savings^].

== Service levels
Sustainability SLA is based on the following consumption criteria: 

|===
|*Service level* | *SLA criteria* |*Minimum committed capacity* |*Platform*
a|
Extreme |<=8 W/TiB |200 TiB |AFF A800 and AFF A900
a|
Premium |<=4 W/TiB |300 TiB |AFF A800 and AFF A900 
a|
Performance |<=4 W/TiB |300 TiB |AFF A800 and AFF A900 
|===

== Service credits
If W/TiB consumption during a billing period fails to meet the SLA criteria, then NetApp issues service credits as follows: 

|===
|Days SLA missed in billing period|Service credit

a|1 to 2
a|3%

a|3 to 7
a|15%

a|14
a|50%

|===

== Service credit request
If a breach of the SLA is detected, open a priority 3 (P3) support ticket with Keystone Global Services and Support Center (GSSC), and provide the details as requested in the excel sheet as shown below:

[NOTE]
====
* A service credit request should be initiated within six weeks after GSSC has validated a breach. All service credits should be acknowledged and approved by NetApp. 
* Service credits may be applied to a future invoice. Service credits do not apply to expired Keystone subscriptions. To learn more, refer to link:../concepts/gssc.html[NetApp Global Services Support Center].
