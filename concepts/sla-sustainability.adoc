[.lead]
NetApp Keystone offers sustainability SLA that ensures a maximum power consumption, measured in watts per tebibyte (W/TiB), for storage services based on ONTAP flash storage arrays. This SLA defines the maximum consumption in W/Tib for each qualifying service level, helping organizations meet sustainability goals.


== Metrics
The following are the key metrics:

* *Watts*: The power consumption reported from daily AutoSupport, including the usage by the controller and attached disk shelves. 
* *Tebibyte*: The maximum of:
** the committed capacity + allocated burst capacity for the service level, or
** the effective deployed capacity, assuming a storage efficiency factor of `2:1`. 

+
To learn more about storage efficiency ratio, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/task_analyze_storage_efficiency.html[Analyze capacity and storage efficiency savings^].

== Service levels
Sustainability SLA is based on the following consumption criteria: 

|===
|*Service level* | *SLA criteria* |*Minimum committed capacity* |*Platform*
a|
Extreme |<=8 W/TiB |200 TiB |AFF A800 and AFF A900
a|
Premium |<=4 W/TiB |300 TiB |AFF A800 and AFF A900 
a|
Performance |<=4 W/TiB |300 TiB |AFF A800 and AFF A900 
|===

== Service credits
If W/TiB consumption during a billing period fails to meet the SLA criteria, NetApp issues service credits as follows: 

|===
|Days SLA missed in billing period|Service credit

a|1 to 2
a|3%

a|3 to 7
a|15%

a|14
a|50%

|===

== Service credit request
If a breach of the SLA is detected, a service credit request can be initiated within six weeks of the validation of the event. All service credits should be acknowledged and approved by NetApp. 

To request service credits, follow these steps:

. Open a priority 3 (P3) support ticket with Keystone Global Services and Support Center (GSSC). The following details are required:
.. Keystone subscription number
.. Volumes and storage controller details 
.. Site, time, date, and description of the issue 
.. Calculated time duration of latency detection
.. Measurement tools and methods
.. Any other applicable document.
. Provide the details in the excel sheet as shown below for a P3 ticket opened with Keystone GSSC.

Service credits may be applied to a future invoice. Service credits do not apply to expired Keystone subscriptions. To learn more, refer to link:../concepts/gssc.html[NetApp Global Services Support Center].
