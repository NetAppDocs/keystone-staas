NetApp guarantees the recovery of Snapshot data from SnapLock Compliance volumes in the event of a ransomware attack with the Ransomware Recovery Guarantee program. NetApp Ransomware Recovery Assurance Service is required to support the Ransomware Recovery Guarantee program and should be purchased separately from the associated Keystone order.

== Service levels
Ransomware Recovery Assurance Service is required for all hardware supporting the Keystone subscription for the duration of the applicable subscription term.

== Service credits

NOTE: SLAs and guarantees are available on a nomination basis.

If SnapLock Compliance is deployed as per best practices, and NetApp professional services either configure it or validate it upon the purchase of Ransomware Recovery Assurance Service, then NetApp issues the service credits if the data protected by SnapLock is not recoverable. The criteria for these credits are as follows:

* Service credits can be applied to future invoices. The credits are capped at 10% of the Committed Contract Value (CCV) and are paid out on a per-subscription basis.
* Credits are provided during the active subscription term of the relevant Keystone order.
* For subscriptions with monthly billing, the credits will be divided over the next 12 months and can be used for any future Keystone invoices until the end of the subscription term.  If the subscription ends in less than 12 months, it can be renewed to continue using the credits, or the credits can be applied to other NetApp invoices.
* For annual subscriptions, the credits will be applied to the next Keystone invoice, if available. If there are no future Keystone invoices, the credits can be applied to other NetApp invoices.
