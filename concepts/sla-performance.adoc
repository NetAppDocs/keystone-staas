[.lead]
NetApp Keystone offers latency-based SLA per service level, as described in the Keystone order for consumed capacity up to the burst limit, according to the following listed terms and conditions.



== Service levels
All service levels that NetApp ONTAP flash storage arrays support are eligible for Performance SLA and guarantee meeting the following target latency:

|===
|*Service level* | Extreme |Premium |Performance |Standard
a|
*Target 90^th^ percentile latency* |<1ms |<2ms |<4ms |<4ms
|===

To learn more about the latency requirements of the service levels, refer to link:../concepts/service-levels.html[Service Levels in Keystone].

== Service credits
NetApp issues service credits for the degraded performance:

|===
|*Performance threshold*|*Service credit*
a|90^th^ percentile latency > target latency | 3% for calendar day of occurrence
|===

== Service credit calculation

The service credit is determined using the following formula:

Service credit = (impacted capacity / total committed capacity) X capacity fees X affected days X credit percentage

Where:

* *impacted capacity*: The amount of stored capacity affected.
* *total committed capacity*: The committed capacity for the service level for the Keystone order.
* *capacity fees*: The fees for the affected performance level as per the Keystone order.
* *affected days*: The number of calendar days impacted.
* *credit percentage*: The predetermined percentage for service credit.

*Example*

The following example shows the method of calculation for service credit:

|===
|*Service level*|*Impacted capacity*|*Total committed capacity*|*Capacity fees*|*Affected calender days*|*Credit percentage*
a|Extreme| 10 Tib | 50 Tib | $1000 | 2 | 3%
|===

Using the formula:
Service credit = ( 10 / 50 ) X 1000 x 2 x 0.03

Based on calculation, the service credit will be $12.

== Service credit request
If a breach of the SLA is detected, a service credit request can be initiated within six weeks of the validation of the event. All service credits should be acknowledged and approved by NetApp. 

To request service credits, follow these steps:

. Open a priority 3 (P3) support ticket with Keystone Global Services and Support Center (GSSC). The following details are required:
.. Keystone subscription number
.. Volumes and storage controller details 
.. Site, time, date, and description of the issue 
.. Calculated time duration of latency detection
.. Measurement tools and methods
.. Any other applicable document
. Provide the details in the excel sheet as shown below for a P3 ticket opened with Keystone GSSC.

Service credits may be applied to future invoices. Service credits do not apply to expired Keystone subscriptions. To learn more, refer to link:../concepts/gssc.html[NetApp Global Services Support Center].
