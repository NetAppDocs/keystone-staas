Keystone STaaS subscriptions are billed on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually basis.

== Monthly billing
Invoices are sent monthly. For the month in which the services are availed, an invoice is sent in the next month. For example, the invoice for the services you have used in January is delivered at the beginning of February. This invoice includes the charges for the committed capacity and if applicable, any burst usage.

== Quarterly, semi-annually, and annually billing
For quarterly, semi-annually, and annually billing, the process is similar with slight variations in timing:

* *Quarterly billing*: An invoice is generated at the beginning of each subscription quarter for the minimum payment of the committed capacity. Another invoice is sent at the end of the quarter for any burst usage accrued.
* *Semi-annually billing*: An invoice is generated at the beginning of every six months for the minimum payment of the committed capacity. Another invoice is sent at the end of each quarter for any burst usage accrued.
* *Annually billing*: An invoice is generated at the beginning of each subscription year for the minimum payment of the committed capacity. Another invoice is sent at the end of each quarter for any burst usage accrued.

For quarterly, semi-annual, and annual billing, if the committed capacity is changed during a subscription, an invoice is sent on the same day for the prorated minimum payments for the rest of that subscription year. Billing is calculated from the day the change in committed capacity becomes effective.
