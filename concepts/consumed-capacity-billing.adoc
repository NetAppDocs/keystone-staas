Keystone also has metering based on the capacity consumed by customers.

As a part of the Keystone service deployment, NetApp continuously monitors and measures the consumption of the service. Every five minutes, a consumption record is generated by the system, detailing the current consumed capacity for the subscription. These records are aggregated over the billing period to generate invoices and usage reports
