Keystone STaaS has metering based on the capacity consumed by you during your service usage. Consumed capacity is the capacity that your workloads actually use.

As a part of the Keystone service deployment, NetApp continuously monitors and measures the consumption of the service. At least once in every five minutes, a consumption record is generated by the system, detailing the current consumed capacity for your subscription. These records are aggregated over the billing period to generate invoices and usage reports.

For information about different capacities supported in Keystone, see link:../concepts/supported-storage-capacity.html[Supported storage capacities in Keystone].
