The NetApp Keystone STaaS pay-as-you-go subscription service offers flexible and scalable consumption with predictable and upfront pricing for your storage requirements.

Keystone for version 3 (v3) provides you with the following billing facilities:

* You can pay based on IOPS and latency committed capacity to meet various workload needs. The different performance service tiers - Extreme, Premium, Standard, Value, Object, and Cloud Volumes ONTAP enable you to manage your storage based on your purchased service level.
* It presents predictable billing for the committed capacity and pay-per-use for variable (burst) capacity usage.
* You can select a bundle price for hardware, core OS, and support for one $/TiB price. You have a single invoice for each storage type, unified, block, optimized, object, or cloud storage services.
* You can select a flexible term for the services and payment options, such as monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual.

Keystone billing is based on committed capacity and variable burst consumption.
