[.lead]
The capacity requirements for Keystone STaaS performance service levels in version 2 (v2) differ between the file, block, object, or cloud storage offerings supported by the Keystone STaaS subscription.


== Minimum capacity requirements for file and block services

The minimum capacity and incremental capacity allowed per subscription is described in the following table. The minimum capacity per performance service level is defined to be the same across Keystone sales motions. The capacity above the minimum capacity either at the beginning of the subscription, or as an add-on service to the subscription, or after reallocation during the subscription is also structured in the table.

|===
|Capacity |Extreme |Premium |Performance |Standard |Value
a|Minimum capacity [in TiB]
3+|25
2+|100
a|Incremental capacity (and in multiples) allowed at start of subscription [in TiB]
3+|25
2+|25
a|Incremental capacity (and in multiples) allowed as add-on during subscription [in TiB]
3+|25
2+|25

== Minimum capacity requirements for object storage

== 	Capacity adjustments
Learn more about capacity adjustments:

* Capacity can be added anytime during the term, except for the last 90 days of the contract term, in the increments per performance service level as described in the tables in the previous section. Addition of capacity or services is allowed within the last 90 days of the contract term as long as there is a consent of service renewal. Any addition in capacity, new service on-prem or cloud can co-term with the existing term. The invoice sent to you following the activation of the new services reflects the revised billing. Committed capacity of cloud services cannot be reduced at any point during the subscription term. Meanwhile, committed capacity and committed spend on the on-premises services during the term of the contract can be reduced based on certain criteria as defined in the following section _Capacity reduction_. 
* A burst capacity is available at each site, based on the Keystone agreement. Usually, it is 20% above the committed capacity for a performance service level. Any burst usage is billed only for that billing period. If you have additional burst requirement greater than the capacity you agreed upon, contact support.
* Committed capacity can be altered during a contract term, only under certain conditions, as described in the following section _Capacity reduction_.
* Increasing capacity or changing to higher performance service level during a subscription term is allowed. However, moving from a higher performance service level to a lower performance service level is not permitted.
* Any change request in the last 90 days of the service term requires a renewal of the service for a minimum of one year.

=== Capacity reduction
Capacity reduction (annual) is applicable to the _Annual in Advance_ payment model and on-premises only deployments. It is not available for cloud services or hybrid cloud services. It provides provision for on-premises capacity, which can be reduced by up to 25% per service level per subscription. This reduction is allowed once every year to be made effective at the beginning of the next annual billing period. On-premises service-based annual payments should be >=$200K anytime during the term in order to take advantage of capacity reduction. Because it is supported only for on-premises deployments, this billing model does not provide reallocation in spending from on-premises to cloud services. An example of annual capacity reduction is illustrated in the following image.

=== Quarterly spend reallocation
Keystone STaaS offers you the option to reallocate on-premises service spend to Cloud Volumes ONTAP spend.

Requirements and conditions at a subscription level:

*	Applies only to monthly billing in arrear model.
*	Applies only to subscriptions with 1, 2, or 3-year term commitments.
*	Capacity for Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Backup service should be purchased through Keystone.
*	Up to 25% of the existing on-premises, service-based monthly payments can be used for reallocation to cloud services.
*	Reallocation requests are made effective only after 90 days from the previous activation date of the reallocation.
*	Reallocation cannot be done from cloud services back to on-premises services.
*	A request to reallocate should be formally submitted by the customer or partner to Keystone Success Manager (KSM) at least one week before the next billing cycle.
*	New requests go into effect only from the consecutive billing cycle.

You can allocate a portion of your expenses towards your subscribed file, block, or object storage performance service levels to hybrid cloud storage services. Up to 25% of the Annual Contract Value (ACV) can be reallocated on a quarterly basis to Cloud Volumes ONTAP Primary and Cloud Volumes ONTAP Secondary services:

This table provides a set of sample values to demonstrate how the reallocation of expenses works. In this example, `$5000` from the monthly spend is reallocated to hybrid cloud storage service.


|===
|*Before allocation* | *Capacity (TiB)* |*Monthly designated expense* 
| Extreme |125 | 37,376 
|*After reallocation* | *Capacity (TiB)* |*Monthly designated expense* 
| Extreme |108 | 37,376 
| Cloud Volumes ONTAP |47 | 5,000 
|||37,376 

|===

The reduction is of (125-108) = 17 TiB of the capacity allocated for the Extreme performance service level. On spend reallocation, the allotted hybrid cloud storage is not of 17 TiB but an equivalent capacity that $5000 can purchase. In this example, for $5000, you can get 17 TiB on-prem storage capacity for the Extreme performance service level and 47 TiB hybrid cloud capacity of Cloud Volumes ONTAP performance service level. Therefore, the reallocation is with respect to the spend, not capacity.

Contact your Keystone Success Manager (KSM) if you want to reallocate expenses from your on-premises services to cloud services.
