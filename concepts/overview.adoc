NetApp Keystone (Keystone) is a pay-as-you-grow subscription-based service model that delivers a seamless hybrid cloud experience for those preferring OpEx consumption models to upfront CapEx or leasing.

It enables customers to accelerate time to value by reducing the hurdles related to managing the unpredictable capacity growth and going through the complex procurement cycles. Keystone allows customers to align economics and operations to their business priorities.
