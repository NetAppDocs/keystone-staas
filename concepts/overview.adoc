Keystone provides storage capacity at predefined performance service levels for file, block and object storage types. This storage can be deployed on-premises and operated by NetApp, a partner, or the customer. Keystone can be used in association with NetApp cloud services, such as Cloud Volumes ONTAP that can be deployed on a hyperscalar environment of your choice.

//A Keystone subscription is associated with rate plans. There can be multiple rate plans attached to a single subscription.

== Keystone Storage-as-a-service (STaaS)

Storage-as-a-service (STaaS) offerings aim to deliver a public cloud-like model for the procurement, deployment, and management of storage infrastructure. While many enterprises are still working on their strategy for hybrid cloud, Keystone STaaS offers the flexibility to start with on-premises services and transition to the cloud when the time is right. This ensures that you can protect your commitments across different deployment models, reallocating your spending as needed without increasing your monthly bill.


//Storage-as-a-service (STaaS) offerings aim to deliver a public cloud-like model for the procurement, deployment, and management of storage infrastructure. While the majority of enterprises are still working on their strategy for hybrid cloud, you, as a customer, can opt for an OpEx-based _pay-per-use_ consumption model. You might have a mandate to move all your workloads to cloud eventually, and yet not have a clear plan or schedule to migrate specific portions or all of your workloads over to the cloud. Keystone STaaS provides you with the flexibility to start with on-premises services and decide later on the right workloads and point in time to move to the cloud. Keystone STaaS provides commitment protection across deployment models. Instead of paying more for cloud services, you, as an on-premises customer, can reallocate your on-premises spending to add cloud services and essentially pay the same monthly bill that was committed prior to this reallocation.
