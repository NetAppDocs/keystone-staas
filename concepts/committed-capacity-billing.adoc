NetApp Keystone (Keystone) billing is based on the capacity committed to you as a part of Keystone service subscription.

Committed capacity refers to the capacities for various services in a single subscription, as accepted by you and NetApp/partner. This capacity is stated on each Keystone order and is billed, regardless of the actual consumption.

For information about different capacities supported in Keystone, see link:../concepts/supported-storage-capacity.html[Supported storage capacities in Keystone]
