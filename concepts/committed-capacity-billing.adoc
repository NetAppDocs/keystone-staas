NetApp Keystone (Keystone) billing is based on the capacity committed to customers as a part of Keystone service subscription.

Committed capacity refers to the capacities for various services in a single subscription, as accepted by NetApp/partner and customers. This capacity is stated on each Keystone order and is billed, regardless of the actual consumption.

For information about different capacities supported in Keystone, see link:..concepts/committed-capacity-billing.html[Supported storage capacities in Keystone]
