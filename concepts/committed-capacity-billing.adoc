Committed capacity is the capacity committed for a particular performance service level while purchasing the subscription.

Committed capacity can be the total capacity for various performance service levels in a single subscription, as accepted by you and NetApp/partner. This capacity is stated on each Keystone order and is billed, regardless of the actual capacity consumption.

For information about different capacities supported in Keystone, see link:../concepts/supported-storage-capacity.html[Supported storage capacities in Keystone].
