##Keystone STaaS for version 3 offers data storage capacity at pre-defined performance service levels. Each volume managed by Keystone services is associated with a performance service level.##

A subscription can have multiple rate plans and each rate plan corresponds to a performance service level. Each rate plan has a committed capacity per performance service level. 

##Each performance service level is defined by input/output operations per second (IOPS), throughput (GBps), and latency (ms). A performance service level can have multiple instances, with each instance representing a separate storage array assigned to that performance service level in the customer's environment.##

You select performance service levels based on your storage environment, and storage and consumption needs. The base performance service levels are available for you by default. Specific performance service levels are additionally available, if you have opted for add-on services. For example, for the advanced data protection add-on service, the _Advanced Data-Protect_ performance service level is assigned to your subscription.

[TIP]
A detailed service description for NetApp Keystone STaaS performance service levels is available https://www.netapp.com/services/keystone/terms-and-conditions/[here^].

The base performance service levels for the supported storage types, unified, block optimized, object, and cloud services are described in the following sections:

== ##Performance service levels for unified storage##

=== ##More on performance service levels for unified and block optimized storage##

The base performance service level metrics depend on the following conditions:

* ##(verify this)## The performance service levels for unified storage support ONTAP 9.8 and later.
* ##IOPS values for performance service levels are based on random combination of 70% read and 30% write IO operations, using an 8 KB block size.##
* ##Throughput values for performance service levels are based on sequential input-output operations, 100% read, using a 32 KB block size.##
* Latency does not include the following: 
** application or host latency
** customer network latency to or from the controller ports
** overheads associated with the data transfer to the object store in case of FabricPool
* ##Latency values are not applicable to MetroCluster write operations. These write operations are dependent on the distance of remote systems.##
* _Expected IOPS_ is targeted for FabricPool only if the tiering policy is set to "none" and no blocks are in the cloud. _Expected IOPS_ is targeted for volumes that are not in a SnapMirror synchronous relationship.

== ##Performance service levels for object storage##
*Supported protocol*: S3

|===
|*Performance service level* | *Standard* | *Value* 
|*Platform* |SGF6112 |SG6160
|*Minimum committed capacity per order* | 200 TiB | 500 TiB 
|*Incremental committed capacity increase* | 25 TiB | 100 TiB
|*Committed and metered capacity type*
2+| Physical
|===

== Cloud storage

*Supported protocols*: NFS, CIFS, iSCSI, and S3 (AWS and Azure only)

|===
|*Performance service level* | Cloud Volumes ONTAP
|*Platform* | Cloud Volumes ONTAP
|*Minimum committed capacity per order* | 4 TiB  
|*Incremental committed capacity increase* | 1 TiB 
|*Committed and metered capacity type*| Logical

[NOTE]
====
- Cloud native services, such as compute, storage, networking, are invoiced by cloud providers.
- These services are dependent on cloud storage and compute characteristics.
