Keystone STaaS standard services for file and block storage include tiering capabilities that identify less-frequently used data, and tiers it to Keystone STaaS-supported NetApp cold storage. You can use data tiering as an add-on service if you want to tier your cold data to any Keystone STaaS-supported, non-NetApp storage.

For information about standard and add-on services, see link:../concepts/supported-storage-services.html[Keystone STaaS services].
For information about performance service Levels, see link:../concepts/service-levels.html[Performance service levels in Keystone].


[Note]

The tiering add-on service is required only when data is tiered to any non-NetApp storage such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and other, Keystone STaaS-supported, S3-compatible, third party object storage.

The tiering capability leverages the NetApp FabricPool technology that enables automated tiering of infrequently accessed data to object storage tiers on and off premises.

The add-on data tiering service enables tiering from Extreme, Premium, Performance, Standard, and Value tier to an object storage target. The ratio of hot is to cold data to be tiered is not fixed, and each tier is metered and invoiced separately. 

For example, if the target for cold storage tier is:

*	Keystone STaaS Value tier, Keystone STaaS StorageGRID Object Tier, or existing SGWS grid (customer owned) - There is no additional charge; it is part of the standard service.
*	Public cloud (AWS, Azure, Google) or Keystone STaaS-supported, third party object storage - There is an additional charge for data capacity that is tiered to cold storage target.

The charges for add-on tiering services apply through the entire subscription term.

[NOTE]
Hyperscalar-based compute, storage, and network services required by Cloud Volumes ONTAP are not provided by NetApp as a part of Keystone STaaS subscriptions; these services need to be procured directly from hyperscalar cloud service providers.
