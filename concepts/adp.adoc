You can subscribe to the advanced data protection add-on service with your Keystone STaaS subscription. This add-on service uses NetApp MetroCluster technology to ensure efficient data protection of your mission-critical workloads with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 0.

[NOTE]
Keystone STaaS standard services for file and block storage offer default data protection services by using NetApp technologies, such as SnapMirror, SnapVault, and Snapshot. 

For information about the standard and cloud service, see link:../concepts/supported-storage-services.html[Keystone STaaS services].

Keystone advanced data protection service can synchronously mirror data to a secondary site. In case of a disaster at the primary site, the secondary site can take over, without any loss of data. This feature uses the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster[MetroCluster^] configuration between two sites to enable data protection. You can use the advanced data protection add-on services for only your file and block storage services. As a part of this add-on service, the `Advanced Data-Protect` performance service level is assigned to your subscription.


You can monitor consumption and health metrics for your MetroCluster configuration. For more information, see link:../integrations/adp-tab.html[View consumption and health of your MetroCluster subscriptions].

== Understand pricing
The advanced data protection add-on service is priced based on the committed capacity at each site. This helps determine the actual cost of advanced data protection service in $/TiB. The add-on charges apply to all capacities in your subscription, including source data, mirrored copies, and unmirrored data.

For the MetroCluster configuration, each site requires its own subscription, and you are charged for the committed capacity at each site independently. 

Note the following:

* The service uses 100% of the committed capacity on associated storage as committed capacity.
* Charges apply to both primary and secondary sites, covering both source and destination clusters.
* Charges apply only to your file and block storage services.

The following MetroCluster scenarios are supported:
