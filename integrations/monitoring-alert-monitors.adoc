You can view and create alert monitors for your Keystone subscriptions from the Keystone dashboard in BlueXP. The dashboard displays both system-generated and user-defined monitors for capacity usage and subscription expiration. You can create custom monitors to set thresholds, choose alert severity, and add email recipients for notifications. This functionality is not available in Digital Advisor.

To view the list of alert monitors and create custom monitors, follow these steps:

.Steps
. From the BlueXP left navigation menu, select *Storage > Keystone > Monitoring > Alert monitors*.
