You can view and create alert monitors for your Keystone subscriptions from the Keystone dashboard in the NetApp Console. The dashboard displays both system-generated and user-defined monitors for capacity usage and subscription expiration. You can create monitors to set thresholds, choose alert severity, and add email recipients for notifications. This functionality is not available in Digital Advisor.

.Steps

You can view a list of alert monitors across your Keystone subscriptions, including monitor names, alert conditions that trigger notifications, severity levels, subscription numbers, performance service levels, and status. You can check the *Created by* column to determine whether the alert monitors are system-generated or user-defined.

== Create and manage alert monitors

From the *Alert monitors* tab, you can create monitors to track capacity usage and subscription expiration. You can also edit, duplicate, or delete existing monitors as needed.
