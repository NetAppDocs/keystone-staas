You can view and create alert monitors for your Keystone subscriptions from the Keystone dashboard in the NetApp Console. The dashboard shows both system-generated and user-defined monitors for capacity usage and subscription expiration. You can create monitors to set thresholds, choose alert severity, and add email recipients for notifications. You can address coverage gaps by adding monitors to uncovered subscriptions or resolving unused monitors. This functionality is not available in Digital Advisor.

== View alert monitors

To view alert monitors, follow these steps:

.Steps
. From the Console left navigation menu, select *Storage > Keystone > Monitoring > Alert monitors*.

+
You can view a list of alert monitors across your Keystone subscriptions, including monitor names, alert conditions that trigger notifications, severity levels, subscription numbers, performance service levels, and status. You can check the *Created by* column to see whether the alert monitors are system-generated or user-defined.
+
NOTE: The *Reports* tab is currently unavailable for Keystone subscriptions.


== Create and manage alert monitors

From the *Alert monitors* tab, you can create monitors to track capacity usage and subscription expiration. You can also edit, duplicate, or delete existing monitors as needed.

NOTE: You must be assigned to the *Keystone admin* role to create and manage alert monitors. To learn more, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-keystone-roles.html[Keystone access roles in NetApp Console^].
