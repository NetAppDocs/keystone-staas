You can view detailed information about ONTAP clusters and nodes, as well as the StorageGRID grids, sites, and nodes, managed by a single Keystone subscription. This view of your subscription assets is available in the Keystone dashboard views from both BlueXP and Digital Advisor. 

== View Keystone subscription assets from BlueXP 

The *Assets* tab within the *Subscriptions* tab in BlueXP provides detailed information about volumes in clusters, StorageGRID nodes, and ONTAP nodes associated with the subscription, including various details and capacity status. 

NOTE: This view is limited to one Keystone subscription at a time. You can also see the assets of other subscriptions by selecting from the *Tracking ID* dropdown list. The Keystone dashboard in BlueXP allows you to view assets across multiple Keystone subscriptions. To learn more, refer to link:../integrations/assets.html[View assets across your Keystone subscriptions].

You can view this information by following these steps:
