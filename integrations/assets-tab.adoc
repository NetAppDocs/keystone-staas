Use the *Assets* tab to gather perspectives on your cluster and nodes managed by your Keystone subscriptions. 

Active IQ Digital Advisor (Digital Advisor) provides a comprehensive inventory-level information of your deployments. The *Assets* tab of the Keystone dashboard, on the other hand, accumulates the cluster-level information on the basis of your subscriptions, and segregates and presents it with the accurate level of details.

.Steps
. Click *GENERAL > Keystone Subscriptions > Assets*.
. Select the subscription number for which you want to view the clusters.

You see the cluster details, broken down by storage efficiency settings, platform type, and capacity details. Clicking on one of the clusters takes you to the *Clusters* widget on the Digital Advisor screen, where you get additional information for that cluster.
