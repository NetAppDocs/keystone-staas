To gain insights into subscription assets, you can view detailed information about ONTAP clusters and nodes, StorageGRID grids, sites, and nodes managed by your Keystone subscriptions through BlueXP or Digital Advisor.

The *Assets* tab within the *Subscriptions* tab in BlueXP provides detailed information about volumes in clusters, StorageGRID nodes, and ONTAP nodes associated with the subscription, including various attributes and capacity status. You can view this information by following these steps:
