##Use the *Assets* tab to view details of ONTAP clusters and nodes, and StorageGRID grids, sites, and nodes managed by your Keystone subscriptions.##

##The *Assets* tab of the Keystone dashboard includes two sub-tabs: *ONTAP* and *StorageGRID*. This tab accumulates cluster-level information for ONTAP and grid-level information for StorageGRID based on your subscriptions, segregating and presenting the data with accurate details. You can view this information by clicking on the respective sub-tabs.##
