You can view detailed information about ONTAP clusters and nodes, as well as the StorageGRID grids, sites, and nodes, managed by a single Keystone subscription. This view of your subscription assets is available in the Keystone dashboard options from both BlueXP and Digital Advisor.  

This view is limited to one Keystone subscription at a time. You can also see the assets of other subscriptions by selecting from the *Tracking ID* dropdown list. The BlueXP Keystone dashboard allows you to view assets across multiple Keystone subscriptions. To learn more, refer to link:../integrations/assets.html[View assets across your Keystone subscriptions].
