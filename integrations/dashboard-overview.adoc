=== About NetApp Console

Keystone is accessible through the NetApp Console.

The NetApp Console provides centralized management of NetApp storage and data services across on-premises and cloud environments at enterprise scale. The Console is required to access and use NetApp data services. As a management interface, it enables you to manage many storage resources from one interface. Console administrators can control access to storage and services for all systems within the enterprise.

You donâ€™t need a license or subscription to start using NetApp Console and you only incur charges when you need to deploy Console agents in your cloud to ensure connectivity to your storage systems or NetApp data services. However, some NetApp data services accessible from the Console are licensed or subscription-based.

Note the following:

* While the NetApp Console and Digital Advisor offer some exclusive features, the NetApp Console provides administrative functionality for Keystone, allowing you to manage subscriptions and make necessary adjustments.
* You must be assigned to the *Keystone admin* role to modify subscriptions. To learn more, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles^].
* Digital Advisor is integrated with the NetApp Console, allowing you to access all Digital Advisor features, including the Keystone dashboard, directly from the NetApp Console.
