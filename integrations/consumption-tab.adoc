== Accrued burst computation
The accrued burst usage for an entire month is calculated as this:

[sum of bursts in month / ((days in month) x 24 x 60)] x interval duration

You can calculate the accrued burst for short periods, such as every two minutes, using this:

[burst / ((days in month) x 24 x 60)] x interval duration

The burst is the difference between the consumed capacity and the committed capacity. For example, with a 30-day in month, if the consumed capacity reaches 120 TiB and the committed capacity is 100 TiB for a 2-minute interval, this results in a burst capacity of 20 TiB, equating to an accrued burst usage of 0.000925926 TiB for that interval.

== View accrued burst
You can view the accrued burst data usage through BlueXP or Digital Advisor. If you have selected *Accrued burst* from the *View* dropdown in the *Consumption trend* tab in BlueXP, or the *Invoiced Accrued Burst* option from the *Consumption Trend* tab in Digital Advisor, you can see accrued burst data usage on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on your selected billing period. This data is available for the last 12 months that have been billed, and you can query by the date range for up to past 30 months. Bar charts display the invoiced data, and if the usage has not yet been billed, it will be marked as _Pending_ for that period.

TIP: The invoiced accrued burst usage is calculated per billing period, based on the committed and consumed capacity for a performance service level.

For a quarterly billing period, if the subscription starts on a date other than the 1^st^ of the month, the quarterly invoice will cover the subsequent 90-day period. For example, if your subscription starts on August 15, the invoice will be generated for the period from August 15 to October 14.

If you switch from quarterly to monthly billing, the quarterly invoice will still cover the 90-day period, with two invoices generated in the last month of the quarter: one for the quarterly billing period and another for the remaining days of that month. This transition allows the monthly billing period to start on the 1^st^ of the following month. For example, if your subscription starts on October 15, you will receive two invoices in January—one for October 15 to January 14 and another for January 15 to 31—before the monthly billing period begins on February 1.

This functionality is available in a preview-only mode. Contact your KSM to learn more about this feature.

== View daily accrued burst data usage
You can view daily accrued burst data usage for a monthly or quarterly billing period through BlueXP or Digital Advisor. In BlueXP, the *Accrued burst by days* table provides detailed data including the timestamp, committed, consumed, and accrued burst capacity if you select *Accrued burst* from the *View* dropdown in the *Consumption trend* tab.

image:bxp-accrued-burst-days.png[screenshot showing the accrued burst by days table]

In Digital Advisor, when you click the bar that displays the invoiced data from the *Invoiced Accrued Burst* option, you see the Billable Provisioned Capacity section below the bar chart, offering both graph and table viewing options. The default graph view displays daily accrued burst data usage in a line graph format, showing changes in usage over time.

An example image showing daily accrued burst data usage in a line graph:

image:invoiced-daily-accr-burst-date.png[screenshot showing burst usage data in a line graph format]

You can switch to a table view by clicking the *Table* option at the top right corner of the graph. The table view provides detailed daily usage metrics, including performance service level, timestamp, committed capacity, consumed capacity, and billable provisioned capacity. You can also generate a report of these details in CSV format for future use and comparison.

== Reference charts for advanced data protection for MetroCluster 
If you have subscribed to the advanced data protection add-on service, you can view the breakup of the consumption data for the MetroCluster partner sites on the *Consumption Trend* tab in Digital Advisor.

For information about advanced data protection add-on service, see link:../concepts/adp.html[Advanced data protection].

If the clusters in your ONTAP storage environment are configured in a MetroCluster setup, the consumption data of your Keystone subscription is split in the same historical data chart to display the consumption at the primary and mirror sites for the base performance service levels.

[NOTE]
The consumption bar charts are split for only the base performance service levels. For advanced data protection add-on service, that is the _Advanced Data-Protect_ performance service level, this demarcation does not appear.

.Advanced data protection performance service level

For the _Advanced Data-Protect_ performance service level, the total consumption is split between the partner sites, and the usage at each partner site is reflected and billed in a separate subscription; one subscription for the primary site, and another for the mirror site. That is the reason why, when you select the subscription number for the primary site on the *Consumption Trend* tab, the consumption charts for the advanced data protection add-on service display the discrete consumption details of only the primary site. Because each partner site in a MetroCluster configuration acts both as a source and mirror, the total consumption at each site includes the source and the mirror volumes created at that site.

[TIP]
The tooltip next to the tracking ID of your subscription in the *Current Consumption* tab helps you identify the partner subscription in the MetroCluster setup.

.Base performance service levels

For the base performance service levels, each volume is charged as provisioned at the primary and mirror sites, and hence the same bar chart is split according to the consumption at the primary and mirror sites.

.What you can see for the primary subscription

The following image displays the charts for the _Extreme_ performance service level (base performance service level) and a primary subscription number. The same historical data chart also indicates the mirror site consumption in a lighter shade of the same color code used for the primary site. The tooltip on mouse hover displays the consumption breakup (in TiB) for the primary and mirror sites, 22.24 TiB and 14.86 TiB respectively.

image:mcc-chart-1.png[mcc primary]

For the _Advanced Data-Protect_ performance service level, the charts appear like this:

image:adp-src-1.png[mcc primary base]

.What you can see for the secondary (mirror site) subscription

When you check the secondary subscription, you can see that the bar chart for the _Extreme_ performance service level (base performance service level) at the same data collection point as the partner site is reversed, and the consumption breakup at the primary and mirror sites is 14.86 TiB and 22.24 TiB respectively.

image:mcc-chart-mirror-1.png[mcc mirror]

For the _Advanced Data-Protect_ performance service level, the chart appears like this for the same collection point as at the partner site:
