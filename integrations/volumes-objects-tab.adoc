[.lead]
Use the *Volumes & Objects* tab to view the summary information and details of your ONTAP volumes. For StorageGRID, you can use this tab to read the usage by the individual nodes in your object storage environment.

[NOTE]
The title of this tab varies with the nature of deployment at your site. If you have both ONTAP and object storage, the title of the tab appears as *Volumes & Objects*. For only ONTAP, the name appears *Volumes*. For StorageGRID object storage, you can see the *Objects* tab.

##== View ONTAP volume summary and details##
##The Volumes tab offers different levels of details on your ONTAP system volumes. There are two tabs, one each for the summary and details view of your ONTAP volumes. You can see cluster and volume-level information on the other widgets in Digital Advisor. These tabs accumulate the volume information for Keystone subscriptions and segregate and present them with the required level of details. The *Volume Summary* tab provides an overall count of the volumes mapped to the subscribed service levels. The corresponding volumes are again listed in the *Volume Details* tab with their particulars.##
