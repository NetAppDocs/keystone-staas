Use the *Volumes & Objects* tab to view the summary information and details of your ONTAP volumes. For StorageGRID, you can use this tab to read the usage by the individual nodes in your object storage environment.

[NOTE]
The title of this tab varies with the nature of deployment at your site. If you have both ONTAP and object storage, the title of the tab appears as *Volumes & Objects*. For only ONTAP, the name appears *Volumes*. For StorageGRID object storage, you can see the *Objects* tab.

== View ONTAP volume summary and details
The Volumes tab offers different levels of details on your ONTAP system volumes. There are two tabs, one each for the summary and details view of your ONTAP volumes. The *Volume Summary* tab provides an overall count of the volumes mapped to the subscribed service levels. The corresponding volumes are again listed in the *Volume Details* tab with their particulars.

For the selected Keystone STaaS subscription, you can see the total number of volumes, their AQoS compliance status, count of protected volumes, and the total committed, consumed, and available capacity in all those volumes. If you click the number of non-compliant or protected volumes, it takes you to the *Volume Details* tab, where you can view a filtered list showing either the non-compliant volumes or the protected volumes, based on your selection.
