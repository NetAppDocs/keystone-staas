Use the *Volumes & Objects* tab to view the volume snapshot and details for your ONTAP volumes. For StorageGRID, you use this tab to read the usage by the individual nodes in your object storage environment.

[NOTE]
The title of this tab varies with the nature of deployment at your site. If you have both ONTAP and object storage, the title of the tab appears as *Volumes & Objects*. For only ONTAP, the name appears *Volumes*. For StorageGRID object storage, you can see the *Objects* tab.
