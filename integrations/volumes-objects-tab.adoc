If you want to view capacity details at the volume or object storage level, you can navigate to the *Volumes & Objects* tab in Digital Advisor. For StorageGRID, you can use this tab to read the usage by the individual nodes in your object storage environment. 

You can refer to the *Assets* tab in BlueXP to view these details. To view the details for a specific Keystone STaaS subscription, refer to link:../integrations/assets-tab.html[View assets associated with a Keystone subscription]. If you want to view details across multiple Keystone subscriptions, refer to link:../integrations/assets.html[View assets across your Keystone subscriptions].

[NOTE]
The title of this tab varies with the nature of deployment at your site. If you have both ONTAP and object storage, the title of the tab appears as *Volumes & Objects*. For only ONTAP, the name appears *Volumes*. For StorageGRID object storage, you can see the *Objects* tab.

== View ONTAP volumes and object storage details
The *Volumes & Objects* tab offers insights into ONTAP system volumes and object storage at different levels of detail. For ONTAP volumes, there are two sub-tabs: *Volume Summary*, which provides an overall count of the volumes mapped to the subscribed performance service levels, and *Volume Details*, which lists these volumes again with their specific particulars. The *Objects* sub-tab provides details on object storage for subscriptions that include performance service levels for both file and object storage.

For the selected Keystone STaaS subscription, you can see the total number of volumes, their QoS compliance status, count of protected volumes, and the total committed, consumed, and available capacity in all those volumes. If you click the number of non-compliant or protected volumes, it takes you to the *Volume Details* tab, where you can view a filtered list showing either the non-compliant volumes or the protected volumes, based on your selection.
