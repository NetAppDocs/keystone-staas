If you have subscribed to NetApp Keystone STaaS services, you get an overview of your subscriptions on the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget of the Active IQ Digital Advisor (also known as Digital Advisor) dashboard.

You can search for Keystone subscription details by searching by the first three characters or numbers of a customer name, ##Keystone subscription number##, or a watchlist name that includes multiple customers. For information about how to search Keystone STaaS subscriptions by watchlists, see link:../integrations/keystone-aiq.html#search-by-using-keystone-watchlists[Search by using Keystone watchlists].

Digital Advisor offers a unified dashboard that gives insights into various levels of your subscription data and usage information through the *Switch to old/new dashboard* button.

.Default (old) dashboard 

You can see your customer name and subscription number, account name, start and end dates of the subscription, and the capacity usage graphs as per your subscribed service levels.

[NOTE]
Your consumption data can be retrieved by Keystone Collector or by AutoSupport bundles. If AutoSupport is used, you can see the timestamp for the data collection in UTC time.

.Alternative (new) dashboard 

You can see the breakup of the capacity usage as per your subscriptions, and warnings and alerts that require immediate attention or action. The information appears selectively, depending on your subscriptions and the status of your usage. You can view this information:

* Capacity usage, such as:
** No usage.
** Consumption exceeding 80% of the committed capacity.
** Burst usage.
** Consumptions above the burst capacity.
* Service Level Agreement: This status appears if at least one of your subscriptions has a valid sustainability service level agreement (SLA) with NetApp. The status indicates whether the subscriptions meet the sustainability criteria defined in your SLA. If your subscriptions meet the SLA criteria, you can see the status as _All OK_.
* Alerts: You see alerts for various scenarios if they are applicable to you. You see the total number of subscriptions affected by these scenarios that you can click to view the details.
** *Expiring soon*: In case your subscriptions expire within 90 days.
** *Critical Hardware Upgrades*: If any critical hardware upgrades are pending.
** *AQoS Warnings*: You have volumes without AQoS policies assigned.
