If you have subscribed to NetApp Keystone services, you can view your usage reports and graphs on the Digital Advisor dashboard, on the *Keystone Subscriptions* section.

On clicking the *View more details* link, you can view the details of the subscription, the detailed graphs of your usage based on the subscribed service levels, and the volume details in the different tabs on this screen.

The following usage indicators are used across tabs for marking consumptions within and outside of the committed capacity for a service level:

[NOTE]
When the capacity usage for a service level is maxed out above 80% of the committed capacity (within or above burst) there is an amber/orange indicator for the consumption column/graph. When the usage is within 80-120% of the committed capacity, the burst column/graph has a red indicator. For any usage above the limit (above the burst capacity of 120%), the burst usage columns/graphs are marked in purple.

== Subscription Details
This tab displays all your subscriptions. You can see the subscription number, tracking ID, billing period, such as quarterly or annual, start and end dates of the subscription, and how much of the subscription has been used or overused. 

You can click the image:aiq-ks-time-icon.png[] icon to view the usage breakup in terms of service levels in the *Subscription Time Series* tab.

[NOTE]
For some subscriptions, you might be able to view notifications or warning messages that inform you of the end date or grace period of your subscriptions, or of non-compliant volumes within your managed clusters.
