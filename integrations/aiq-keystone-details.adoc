[.lead]
You use the Active IQ Digital Advisor (also known as Digital Advisor) dashboard for your Keystone STaaS subscriptions to monitor your capacity usage and generate reports. 

On subscribing to Keystone services, you can view the details of your subscription and usage on the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget on the Digital Advisor dashboard.

[NOTE]
The information here applies to both ONTAP and StorageGRID. Exceptions have been pointed out in the relevant sections.

For information about the Keystone Digital Advisor widget, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/view_keystone_capacity_utilization.html[View capacity utilization with NetApp Keystone Subscription^].

To view your Keystone subscription and usage details, perform the following steps:

.Steps

. Log in to Digital Advisor. You can see the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget that summarizes the capacity usage against your purchased Keystone services.
. On the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget, click *View More Details* to view the usage details and alerts on your volumes on the *Keystone Subscriptions* page. Alternately, from the left navigation pane, go to *GENERAL > Keystone Subscriptions*.
The details of the subscriptions, usage charts for each service level, and volume details are displayed in the different tabs on the *Keystone Subscriptions* screen.

[NOTE]
Capacity consumption in Keystone subscriptions is displayed in TiBs on the dashboards and reports, and is rounded off to two decimal places. If the usage is less than 0.01 TiB, then the value is shown as 0 or `No Usage`. The data on these screens is displayed in UTC time (server timezone). When you enter a date for query, it is automatically considered to be in UTC time.

== Generate reports
You can generate and view reports for your Keystone data. Each tab on the  *Keystone Subscriptions* page enables you to generate reports for your subscriptions, historical usage and burst usage, performance, assets, and volumes and objects by clicking the download button: image:download-icon.png[report download icon]

The details are generated in CSV format that you can save for future use and comparison.

== View alerts
Alerts on the dashboard send caution messages that enable you to understand the issues occurring in your storage environment. 

The alerts can be of two types:

* *Information*: For issues, such as your subscriptions nearing an end, you can see information alerts. Hover your cursor over the information icon to learn more about the issue.
* *Warning*: Issues, such as non-compliance, are displayed as warnings. For example, if there are volumes within your managed clusters that do not have adaptive QoS (AQoS) policies attached, you can see a warning message. You can click the link on the warning message to see the list of the non-compliant volumes in the *Volumes* tab.
[NOTE]
If you have subscribed to a single service level or rate plan, you won't be able to see the alert for non-compliant volumes.
