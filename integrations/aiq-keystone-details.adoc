The Active IQ Digital Advisor (Digital Advisor) dashboard provides you with the capability of monitoring the usage pertaining to your NetApp Keystone subscriptions and generating reports. On subscribing to Keystone services, you can view the details of your subscription and usage on the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget on the Digital Advisor dashboard.

[NOTE]
The information available here applies to both ONTAP and StorageGRID. Exceptions have been pointed out in the relevant sections.

For information about the Keystone Digital Advisor widget, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/view_keystone_capacity_utilization.html[View capacity utilization with NetApp Keystone Subscription^].

To view your Keystone subscription and usage details, perform the following steps:

.Steps

. Log in to Digital Advisor. You can see the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget that summarizes the capacity usage against your purchased Keystone services.
. On the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget, click *View More Details* to view the usage details and alerts on your volumes on the *Keystone Subscriptions* page. Alternately, from the left navigation pane, go to *GENERAL > Keystone Subscriptions*.
The details of the subscriptions, usage charts for each service level, and volume details are displayed in the different tabs on the *Keystone Subscriptions* screen.

[NOTE]
Capacity consumption in Keystone subscriptions is displayed in TiBs on the dashboards and reports, and is rounded off to two decimal places. If the usage is less than 0.01 TiB, then the value is shown as 0 or `No Usage`. For other usage metrics, see link:../concepts/metrics.html#metrics-measurement[Metrics measurement]. For information about different capacities used in Keystone, see link:../concepts/supported-storage-capacity.html[Supported storage capacities].

The following details are displayed:

* *Subscription details*: The start and end date of the subscription, and the billing period, for example, quarterly, yearly, and so forth.
* *Usage charts*: The bar charts display the service level name and the capacity consumed against that service level for the date range. The date and time of the collection are displayed at the bottom of the chart.
+
[NOTE]
Based on the date range of your query, the usage charts are displayed in a range of 30 data collection points.
+
The following colors in the bar charts indicate the consumed capacity as defined within the service level:

** Green: Within 80%.
** Amber: 80% - 100%.
** Red: Burst usage (100% of the committed capacity to the agreed burst limit)
** Purple: Above the burst limit or `Above Limit`.
+
[NOTE]
A blank chart indicates that there was no data available in your environment at that data collection point.
+
* *Current Consumed*: Indicator for the consumed capacity (in TiB) defined for the service level. This field uses specific colors for usage:
** Grey: None.
** Green: Within 80% of the committed capacity.
** Amber: Any consumption above 80% of the committed capacity.
* *Current Burst*: Indicator for the consumed capacity within or above the defined burst limit. Any usage within the burst limit agreed upon, for example, 20% above the committed capacity is within the burst limit. Further usage is considered as usage above the burst limit. This field uses specific colors for usage:
** Grey: None.
** Red: Burst.
** Purple: Above the burst limit.
* *Accrued Burst*: Indicator for the accrued burst usage or consumed capacity calculated per month for the current billing period. The accrued burst usage is calculated based on the committed and consumed capacity for a service level: `(consumed - committed)/365.25/12`.
+
[NOTE]
The *Current Consumed*, *Current Burst*, and *Accrued Burst* indicators determine the consumption with respect to the billing period of the subscription, and are not based on the date range of the query.

=== Additional details for advanced data protection 
.Learn more
[%collapsible]
====
If you have subscribed to the advanced data protection add-on service, you can view the breakup of the consumption data for the MetroCluster partner sites on the *Time Series* tab. 

For information about advanced data protection add-on service, see link:../concepts/adp.html[Advanced data protection].

If the clusters in your ONTAP storage environment are configured in a MetroCluster setup, the consumption data of your Keystone subscription is split in the same time series chart to display the consumption at the primary and mirror sites for the base service levels.

[NOTE]
The consumption bar charts are split for only base service levels. For advanced data protection add-on service, that is the _Advanced Data-Protect_ service level, this demarcation does not appear.

.Advanced data protection service level

For the _Advanced Data-Protect_ service level, the total consumption is split between the partner sites, and the usage at each partner site is reflected and billed in a separate subscription; that is one subscription for the primary site, and another for the mirror site. That is why, when you select the subscription number for the primary site on the *Time Series* tab, the consumption charts for the advanced data protection add-on service display the discrete consumption details for only the primary site. Because each partner site in a MetroCluster configuration acts as a source and a mirror, the total consumption at each site includes the source and the mirror volumes created at that site.

[TIP]
The tooltip beside the tacking ID of your subscription in the *Subscription Details* tab helps you identify the partner subscription in the MetroCluster setup.

.Base service levels

For the base service levels, each volumes is charged as provisioned at the primary and mirror sites, and hence the same bar chart is split according to the consumption at the primary and mirror sites.

.What you can see for the primary subscription

The following image displays the charts for the _Extreme_ service level (base service level) and a primary subscription number. The same time series chart marks off the mirror site consumption in a lighter shade of the color code used for the primary site. The tool-tip on mouse hover displays the consumption breakup (in TiB) for the primary and mirror sites, 1.02 TiB and 1.05 TiB respectively.

image:mcc-chart.png[mcc primary]

For the _Advanced Data-Protect_ service level, the charts appear like this:

image:adp-src.png[mcc primary base]

.What you can see for the secondary (mirror site) subscription

When you check the secondary subscription, you can see that the bar chart for the _Extreme_ service level (base service level) at the same data collection point as the partner site is reversed, and the consumption breakup at the primary and mirror sites is 1.05 TiB and 1.02 TiB respectively.

image:mcc-chart-mirror.png[mcc mirror]

For the _Advanced Data-Protect_ service level, the chart appears like this for the same collection point as at the partner site:

image:adp-mir.png[mcc mirror base]
