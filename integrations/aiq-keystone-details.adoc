If you have subscribed to NetApp Keystone services, you can view your usage reports and graphs on the Digital Advisor dashboard, on the *Keystone Subscriptions* section.

On clicking the *View more details* link, you can view the details of the subscription, the detailed graphs of your usage based on the subscribed service levels, and the volume details in the different tabs on this screen. 

== Subscription Details
This tab displays all your subscriptions. You can see the subscription number, tracking ID, billing period, such as quarterly or annual, start and end dates of the subscription, and how much of the subscription has been used or overused. 

You can click the image:aiq-ks-time-icon.png[] icon to view the usage breakup in terms of service levels in the *Subscription Time Series* tab.

[NOTE]
For some subscriptions, you might be able to view notifications or warning messages that inform you of the end date or grace period of your subscriptions, or of non-compliant volumes within your managed clusters.

You can expand a subscription to view the details of the service levels in the subscription. Based on whether your consumption is within the committed capacity for a service level or it is overused (burst), you can see green, orange, or violet usage indicators in the *Consumed* and *Current Burst* columns for that service level.

== Subscription Time Series
This tab displays historical data of your subscriptions for a specific period. The vertical graphs display the usage details across months with appropriate indicators for you to compare and generate reports.
