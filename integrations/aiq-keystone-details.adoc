The Digital Advisor dashboard enables you to view the details of your Keystone subscriptions, monitor capacity usage, and generate reports.

On subscribing to Keystone services, you can view the details of your subscription and usage on the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget on the Digital Advisor dashboard.

[NOTE]
The information here applies to both ONTAP and StorageGRID. Exceptions have been pointed out in the relevant sections.

To learn more about the Keystone Digital Advisor widget, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/view_keystone_capacity_utilization.html[View capacity utilization with NetApp Keystone Subscription^].

To view your Keystone subscription and usage details, perform the following steps:

.Steps

. Log in to Digital Advisor. You can see the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget that summarizes the capacity usage against your purchased Keystone services.
. On the *Keystone Subscriptions* widget, click *View All Subscriptions* to view the usage details and alerts on your volumes on the *Keystone Subscriptions* page. Alternately, from the left navigation pane, go to *GENERAL > Keystone Subscriptions*.
The details of the subscriptions, usage charts for each service level, and volume details are displayed in the different tabs on the *Keystone Subscriptions* screen.

[NOTE]
Capacity consumption in Keystone subscriptions is displayed in TiBs on the dashboards and reports, and is rounded off to two decimal places. If the usage is less than 0.01 TiB, then the value is shown as 0 or `No Usage`. The data on these screens is displayed in UTC time (server timezone). When you enter a date for query, it is automatically considered to be in UTC time.

== Generate reports
You can generate and view reports for your Keystone data. Each tab on the  *Keystone Subscriptions* page enables you to generate reports for your subscriptions, historical usage and burst usage, performance, assets, and volumes and objects by clicking the download button: image:download-icon.png[report download icon]

The details are generated in CSV format that you can save for future use and comparison.

== Generate consolidated report

You can generate and view a consolidated report for your subscriptions, historical usage, burst usage, performance, assets, and volumes and objects. To do this, select *Keystone Subscriptions* as the report type from the Report feature in Digital Advisor. You can generate these reports at the customer, cluster, watchlist, or subscription level.

The report is generated in Excel format, with each type of information, such as subscription details or usage history, displayed on separate sheets. These sheets are named according to the tabs on the *Keystone Subscriptions* page for easy viewing. You can save the report for future use.

== View alerts
The dashboard provides alert notifications that enable you to understand the issues occurring in your storage environment. These notifications may appear as informational alerts or warnings. For example, if there are volumes within your managed clusters that do not have adaptive QoS (AQoS) policies attached, you can see a warning message. You can click the link on the warning message to see the list of the non-compliant volumes in the *Volumes & Objects* tab.

[NOTE]
If you have subscribed to a single service level or rate plan, you won't be able to see the alert for non-compliant volumes.

For information about AQoS policies, see link:../concepts/qos.html[Adaptive QoS].

Contact NetApp support for more information on these messages. For information about raising service requests, see link:../concepts/gssc.html#generating-service-requests[Generating service requests].
