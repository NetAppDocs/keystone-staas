[NOTE]
Capacity consumption values for Keystone subscriptions are displayed in TiBs on the dashboards and reports. If the usage is less than 0.01 TiB, then the value is shown as `0` or in the respective decimal value (up to two decimal places), or represented as `No Usage`.

image:icon-amber.png[]: Indicates maximum consumption, that is the usage is about to reach 100% or more of the committed capacity. This color is applicable for the *Usage Status* and *Consumed* columns.

The following details are displayed:

* *Current Consumed*: This gauge/donut chart indicates the consumed capacity for a service level for the billing period. This chart is grey, green, or amber color-coded to indicate none, normal, or max usage respectively.
* *Current Burst*: This gauge/donut chart indicates the consumed capacity for a service level that is within or above the burst limit. for a service level, any usage between 100 and 120% of the committed capacity is within burst, and above that is `Above Limit`. This chart can be grey, red, or purple to indicate none, burst, or above limit usage respectively.
* *Accrued Burst*: The accrued burst capacity is calculated per month for the current billing period. The accrued burst usage is calculated based on the committed and provisioned capacity for a service level as `(Provisioned - Committed)/365.25/12`.
* *Time Series*: The bar charts display the capacity usage for the time selected. The date and time of the collection is displayed at the bottom of the chart. The charts can be of the following colors:
** Green: Indicating usage within 80% of the committed capacity.
** Red: Indicating burst usage (80%-120% of the committed capacity for the service level).
** Purple: Indicating usage above the burst limit.
** Grey: Indicating provisional usage. Provisional usage data is recorded when the exact data for the time period is not available and is substituted by the data collected at the previous data collection point.

== Alerts
If certain issues or events are detected in the storage system that is managed by your Keystone STaaS subscriptions, you can see alerts informing or cautioning you of these issues. 

For example, you can see an information icon for subscriptions nearing an end or reaching the grace period.

Issues, such as non compliance, are displayed as warnings. For example, if there are volumes within your managed clusters that do not have AQoS policies attached, you can view a warning message. For information about AQoS policies, see link:../concepts/qos.html[Adaptive QoS].
