You can search and filter your data, generate reports for subscriptions and usage, and view alerts to stay informed about your storage environment.

== Search and filter data from BlueXP
In BlueXP, you can search and filter Keystone data based on the column parameters available in the table within a tab. For example, in the *Subscriptions* sub-tab under the *Subscriptions* tab, you can filter data by entering the Keystone version in the search box. Similarly, in the *Volumes in clusters* tab under the *Assets* tab, you can filter volumes by entering volume name in the search box. 

//Filtering is limited to the columns present in the table of the tab. For instance, you cannot filter by Keystone version in the *Volumes in clusters* tab.

You can refine your searches by using the advanced filter option where available. For example, in the *Subscriptions* sub-tab, you can filter data by Keystone version, billing period, highest capacity, and days to subscription expiry, and in the *Volumes in clusters* tab, you can filter by volume name, cluster name, QoS compliance, volume type, and more. Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously to narrow down your results with precision.

//== View last refresh timestamp from BlueXP
//In BlueXP, you can view the "Last updated" timestamp in the top right corner of each tab, which shows when the data was last refreshed. This timestamp updates automatically every 5 to 10 minutes and refreshes when the screen loads. You can also manually refresh the data.

== Generate reports from BlueXP or Digital Advisor
You can generate and view reports for your Keystone data using the download button image:bluexp-download-report-2.png[report download icon 2 in BlueXP] available in tabs within BlueXP or Digital Advisor. These tabs allow you to generate reports for your subscriptions, historical usage, burst usage, performance, assets, volumes and objects.

The details are generated in CSV format that you can save for future use and comparison.

== Generate consolidated report from Digital Advisor

In Digital Advisor, you can generate and view a consolidated report for your subscriptions, historical usage, burst usage, performance, assets, and volumes and objects. To do this, select *Keystone Subscriptions* as the report type from the Report feature in Digital Advisor. You can generate these reports at the customer, cluster, watchlist, or subscription level.

The report is generated in Excel format, with each type of information, such as subscription details or usage history, displayed on separate sheets. These sheets are named according to the tabs on the *Keystone Subscriptions* page for easy viewing. You can save the report for future use.

To learn more about generating reports, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/task_generate_reports.html[Generate custom reports^].

== View alerts from Digital Advisor
In Digital Advisor, the Keystone dashboard provides alert notifications that enable you to understand the issues occurring in your storage environment. These notifications may appear as informational alerts or warnings. For example, with Keystone version 2 (v2), if there are volumes within your managed clusters that do not have adaptive QoS (AQoS) policies attached, you can see a warning message. Select the warning message to see the list of the non-compliant volumes in the *Volumes & Objects* tab.

[NOTE]
If you have subscribed to a single performance service level or rate plan, you won't be able to see the alert for non-compliant volumes.
