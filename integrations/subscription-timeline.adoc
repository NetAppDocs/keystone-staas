The subscription timeline is displayed as a line graph by default, with icons marking important events. Hover over an event to see detailed information, such as the date and changes made to committed capacity during a modification. To view these events in a table, select the *Table* option from the *View as* dropdown. You can also see the timeline of other subscriptions by selecting or searching from the *Tracking ID* dropdown list.
