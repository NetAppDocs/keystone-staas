[Review]When you subscribe to the advanced data protection add-on service, you can view consumption data for your MetroCluster partner sites in either the NetApp Console or Digital Advisor. In the NetApp Console, you can also monitor the replication status and health of your MetroCluster setup and ##take action when synchronization issues occur. (For Sushant-Need to verify whether customers can currently create custom alerts. As of now, automatic alerts are not available. )##

== Understand MetroCluster consumption data 

##(Sushant-please confirm if this is correct)##

*Base performance service levels:*

* Each volume is charged at both primary and mirror sites.
* Consumption charts display usage split between both sites.

*Advanced data protection performance service levels:*

* Total consumption is split between partner sites.
* Each site has a separate subscription (primary and mirror).
* Consumption at each site includes both primary and mirror volumes.
* Selecting a subscription shows only that site's consumption.

For more information, refer to link:../concepts/adp.html[Advanced data protection add-on for Keystone].

== View MetroCluster subscriptions consumption and health status

Follow the steps below:

[role="tabbed-block"]
====
.NetApp Console
--
.Steps
. From the Console left navigation menu, select *Storage > Keystone > Subscriptions*.
. Select the MetroCluster subscription in the *Subscription number* column.
+
TIP: MetroCluster subscriptions are identified by the image:metrocluster-icon.png[MetroCluster subscription symbol] icon.
+
The *Current consumption* tab opens and displays consumption insights for your subscribed base performance service levels and their corresponding advanced data protection performance service levels. You can view this information in a tabular or graphical format. To learn more, refer to link:../integrations/current-usage-tab.html[View the current consumption of your Keystone subscriptions].
. Select the *Advanced data protection (ADP)* tab.
+
On this tab, you can view consumption data for your base performance service levels at both primary and mirror sites ##(Sushant-confirm if we see data only for base service levels)##, monitor the health status of your MetroCluster setup, and track its sync status.
+
* View the consumption distribution chart for your selected time period.
+
The chart shows consumption for both your primary and mirror sites. Hover over the chart to see the consumption breakdown in tebibytes (TiB) for each site.
+
*Example:*
The tooltip displays consumption values such as 1.15 TiB for the primary site and 4.22 TiB for the mirror site.
+

* Monitor the health status of your MetroCluster setup in the *ADP Topology* view.
+
The topology displays the connection status (normal, degraded, disconnected, or initializing), shows whether data is in sync or out of sync, and displays the ONTAP Mediator status if configured. To learn more about ONTAP Mediator, refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/mediator/mediator-overview-concept.html[Learn about ONTAP Mediator^]. ##(Sushant- please confirm if I have mentioned the correct name for the Mediator, I have given the link)##
+
image:adp-topology.png[Image of ADP topology displaying primary site (Cluster A), mirror site (Cluster B), connection status indicators, sync status, and ONTAP Mediator]
+
NOTE: You can select the Cluster B subscription (mirror) from the ADP topology to view it as the primary site.
+
##Question: How to take action when sync status is out of sync or degraded? Open a support case?##
+
* View historical consumption trends for the primary or mirror site.
+
Under *Capacity utilization*, select *View* next to either Cluster A (primary) or Cluster B (mirror).
+
The *Consumption trend* tab opens and displays historical consumption data for the selected cluster over a specified date range. You can analyze capacity usage trends for both base and advanced data protection performance service levels. To learn more, refer to link:../integrations/consumption-tab.html[View consumption trends for your Keystone subscriptions].
+
*Example:*
The following chart shows consumption for the _Premium_ performance service level (base) for the primary site (Cluster A):
+
image:adp-base-consumption.png[Premium performance service level consumption chart for primary site]
+
The following chart shows consumption for the _Advanced data-protect premium_ performance service level for the primary site (Cluster A):
+
image:adp-consumption.png[Advanced Data Protection Premium consumption chart for primary site]
+
NOTE: Advanced data protection splits consumption between partner sites with separate subscriptions. Each chart displays only the capacity utilization for the selected site.

.Digital Advisor
--
.Steps  
. Select *General > Keystone Subscriptions > Consumption Trend*.
. Select the MetroCluster subscription.
+
If the clusters in your ONTAP storage environment are configured in a MetroCluster setup, the consumption data of your Keystone subscription is split in the same historical data chart to display the consumption at the primary and mirror sites for the base performance service levels.
+
NOTE: The consumption bar charts are split for only the base performance service levels. For advanced data protection add-on service, that is the _Advanced Data-Protect_ performance service level, this demarcation does not appear.
+
[TIP]
The tooltip next to the tracking ID of your subscription in the *Current Consumption* tab helps you identify the partner subscription in the MetroCluster setup.
+
*Primary subscription view*
+
The following image displays the charts for the _Performance_ performance service level (base performance service level). The same historical data chart also indicates the mirror site consumption in a lighter shade of the same color code used for the primary site. The tooltip on mouse hover displays the consumption breakup (in TiB) for the primary and mirror sites, 95.04 TiB and 93.38 TiB respectively.
+
image:mcc-chart-2.png[mcc primary]
+
For the _Advanced Data-Protect_ performance service level, the charts appear like this:
+
image:adp-src-2.png[mcc primary base]
+
The displayed consumption of 94.21 TiB represents the usage for the primary subscription. Given that advanced data protection splits consumption between partner sites with separate subscriptions, this chart shows only the primary site usage. To learn about pricing for the advanced data protection add-on service, refer to link:../concepts/adp.html#understand-pricing[Understand pricing].
+
*Mirror subscription view*
+
When you check the mirror subscription, you can see that the bar chart for the _Performance_ performance service level (base performance service level) at the same data collection point as the partner site is reversed, and the consumption breakup at the primary and mirror sites is 93.38 TiB and 95.04 TiB respectively.
+
image:mcc-chart-mirror-2.png[mcc mirror]
+
For the _Advanced Data-Protect_ performance service level, the chart appears like this for the same collection point as at the partner site:
+
