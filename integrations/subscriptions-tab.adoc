[TIP]
If you have subscribed to advanced data protection add-on service, then you can click the tooltip against your subscription number to view the tracking ID of the partner subscription in a MetroCluster setup.

* *Usage Type*: You might have subscribed to multiple Keystone versions. The rate plan rules for performance service levels may differ between subscription versions. By looking at the value in this column, you know whether the usage type is billed as per the provisioned, physical, or logical usage.

* *Billing Period*: The invoicing period of the subscription.
* *Start Date*: The start date of the subscription.
* *End Date*: The end date of the subscription. If you have a monthly-billable subscription that renews automatically every month, you see `Month-on-month` instead of the end date. Based on this date, you might see notifications for subscriptions that are about to end or have auto-renewal policies attached.
* *Usage Status*: Displays the usage indicator to indicate whether the consumption is within or exceeding the subscription limit. You can sort the list by this column if you want to view the highest consumption records.

image:icon-grey.png[grey dot icon] *No consumption*: No capacity usage recorded against the committed capacity of the performance service level.
image:icon-green.png[green dot icon] *Normal*: The consumption is normal.
image:icon-amber.png[amber dot icon] *High*: Maximum consumption, that is the usage is about to reach 100% or more of the committed capacity.
image:icon-red.png[red dot icon] *Burst*: The consumption is within the burst limit. The burst consumption is the consumption that tops the 100% committed capacity of a performance service level, and is within the agreed-upon burst usage limit.
image:icon-purple.png[purple dot icon] *Above burst limit*: Indicates consumption above the agreed-upon burst limit.
