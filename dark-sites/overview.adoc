Keystone offers a _private_ deployment mode, also known as a _dark site_, to meet your business and security requirements. This mode is available for organizations with connectivity restrictions.

NetApp offers a specialized deployment of Keystone STaaS tailored for environments with limited or no internet connectivity (also known as dark sites). These are secure or isolated environments where external communication is restricted due to security, compliance, or operational requirements.

For NetApp Keystone, offering services for dark sites means providing the Keystone flexible storage subscription service in a way that respects the constraints of these environments. This involves:

* *Local deployment*: Keystone can be configured within isolated environments independently, ensuring no need for internet connectivity or external personnel for setup access.
* *Offline operations*: All storage management capabilities with health checks and billing are available offline for operations.
* *Security and compliance*: Keystone ensures that the deployment meets the security and compliance requirements of dark sites, which may include advanced encryption, secure access controls, and detailed auditing capabilities.
* *Help and Support*: NetApp provides 24/7 global support with a dedicated Keystone success manager assigned to each account for assistance and troubleshooting.

NOTE: Keystone Collector can be set up and configured in _standard mode_, which offers full functionality. To learn more, refer to link:../installation/vapp-prereqs.html[Set up and configure Keystone].

== Keystone Collector in private mode

Keystone Collector is responsible for periodically collecting usage data from storage systems and exporting the metrics to an offline usage reporter and a local file store. The generated files, which are created in both encrypted and plain text formats, are then manually forwarded to NetApp by the user after the validation checks. Upon receipt, NetApp's Keystone billing platform authenticates and processes these files, integrating them into the billing and subscription management systems to calculate the monthly charges.

The Keystone Collector service on the server is tasked with periodically gathering usage data, processing this information, and generating a usage file locally on the server. The health service conducts system health checks and is designed to interface with health monitoring systems used by the customer. These reports are available for offline access by users, allowing for validation and aiding in troubleshooting issues.
