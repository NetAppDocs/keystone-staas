Complete a few configuration tasks to enable Keystone Collector to collect usage data in an environment that does not have internet access, also known as a as a _dark site_ or _private mode_. This is a one-time activity to activate and associate the required components with your storage environment.  Once configured, Keystone Collector will monitor all ONTAP clusters managed by Active IQ Unified Manager.

NOTE: Keystone Collector provides you with the Keystone Collector Management Terminal User Interface (TUI) utility to perform configuration and monitoring activities. You can use various keyboard controls, such as the Enter and arrow keys, to select the options and navigate across this TUI.

.Steps

. Start the Keystone Collector management TUI utility:
+
`keystone-collector-tui`
. Go to *Configure > Advanced*.

. Ensure that the Keystone Collector is in a healthy state by returning to the main screen of the TUI and verifying the *Service Status* information. The system should show that the services are in an *Overall: Healthy* status. Wait up to 10 minutes, if the overall status remains unhealthy after this period, review the previous configuration steps and contact the NetApp support team.

. Retrieve the generated public key:
+
`~/collector-public.pem`
+
. Send an email with this file to keystone.services@netapp.com.

== Export usage report
You should send the monthly usage summary report to NetApp at the end of every month. You can generate this report manually.

Follow these steps to generate the usage report:

. Go to to *Export Usage* on the Keystone Collector TUI home screen.
. Collect the files and send them to keystone.services@netapp.com.
+
Keystone Collector generates both a clear file and an encrypted file, which should be manually sent to NetApp. The clear file report contains the following details that can be validated by the customer.
