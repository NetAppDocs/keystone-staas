=== Enhanced logical usage tracking with a new column
A new column, Total footprint, is added to enhance Keystone consumption tracking for FabricPool volumes:

* *Keystone dashboard in BlueXP*: You can see the *Total footprint* column in the *Volumes in clusters* tab within the *Assets* tab.
* *Digital Advisor*: You can see the *Total Footprint* column in the *Volume Details* tab within the *Volumes & Objects* tab.

This column displays the total logical footprint for volumes using FabricPool tiering, including data from both performance and cold tiers, so you can accurately calculate Keystone consumption.
