=== QoS policy override column in Assets tab
The *Volumes in clusters* tab within the *Assets* tab now includes a *QoS policy override* column that indicates whether QoS rules are bypassed for backup and mirror volumes, displaying *true* (rules ignored), *false* (rules enforced), or *N/A* (for mirror volumes).

NOTE: For Keystone v3 subscriptions, this column displays *N/A* as QoS policies are not applicable in the v3 offering.
