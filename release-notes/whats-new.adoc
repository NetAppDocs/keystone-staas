== Support for Elastic Volumes (7 June 2022)

Support for the Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes feature with a Cloud Volumes ONTAP aggregate provides better performance and additional capacity, while enabling BlueXP to automatically increase the underlying disk capacity as needed.

Support for Elastic Volumes is available starting with the 3.9.19 release of the BlueXP Connector and is supported with specific Cloud Volumes ONTAP versions and specific EBS disk types.

== 9.11.0 P1 (2 May 2022)

The Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.11.0 P1 release is now available in AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This release includes the following enhancement.

=== ONTAP S3 support in AWS

You can now provide S3 object storage from Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS (Microsoft Azure is already supported). Cloud Volumes ONTAP supports S3 as an option for scale-out storage, in addition to classic file-based protocols like NFS and SMB.

Note the following:

* The main use case for ONTAP S3 with Cloud Volumes ONTAP is a general purpose object store.
* At this time, the S3 protocol is not supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud.
* BlueXP doesn't provide any management capabilities for the ONTAP S3 feature.
