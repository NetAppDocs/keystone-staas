Known limitations identify platforms, devices, or functions that are not supported by this release of the product, or that do not interoperate correctly with it. Review these limitations carefully.

These limitations are specific to BlueXP set up and administration: the Connector, the SaaS platform, and more.

== Connector limitations

=== Default EC2 instance settings should not be changed

When you deploy the Connector in AWS, the following EC2 instance settings are configured by default:

* IMDSv2 is set to optional
* HttpTokens is set to optional

These settings should not be changed to required. Changing these settings to required impacts the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP availability.

=== Possible conflict with IP addresses in the 172 range

BlueXP deploys the Connector with two interfaces that have IP addresses in the 172.17.0.0/16 and 172.18.0.0/16 ranges.

If your network has a subnet configured with either of these ranges, then you might experience connectivity failures from BlueXP. For example, discovering on-prem ONTAP clusters in BlueXP might fail.
