The Keystone repository is configured to automatically validate the integrity of Keystone software so that only valid and authentic software is installed at your site.

The Keystone YUM repository client configuration provided in `keystonerepo.rpm` makes use of enforced GPG checking (`gpgcheck=1`) on all software downloaded through this repository. Any RPM downloaded through the Keystone repository that fails signature validation is prevented from being installed. This functionality is used in the scheduled auto-update capability of Keystone Collector to ensure only valid and authentic software is installed at your site.
