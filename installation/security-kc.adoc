Verification of root certificates from trusted sources is a part of the Keystone Collector security features. However, you can configure Keystone Collector to trust a root certificate issued by a custom certificate authority (CA).

If you use of SSL/TLS inspection at the border firewall in your environment, it results in internet-based traffic to be re-encrypted with your custom CA certificate. It is necessary to configure the settings to verify the source as a trusted CA before accepting the root certificate and allowing connections to occur. Follow these steps:

.Steps
. Prepare the CA certificate. It should be in _base64-encoded X.509_ file format.
[NOTE]
The supported file extensions are `.pem`, `.crt`, `.cert`. Ensure that the certificate is in one of these formats.
. Copy the certificate to the Keystone Collector server. Make a note of the location where the file is copied.
. Open a terminal on the server and run the management TUI utility.
`$ keystone-collector-tui`
. Go to *Configuration > Advanced*.
. Enable the option *Enable custom root certificate*.
. For *Select custom root certificate path:*, select `- Unset -`
. Press Enter. A dialog box for selecting the certificate path is displayed.
. Select the root certificate from the file system browser or enter the exact path. 
. Press Enter. You return to the *Advanced* screen.
. Select *Save*. the configuration is applied.
