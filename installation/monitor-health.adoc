= Monitor the health of Keystone Collector

[.lead]
You can monitor the health of Keystone Collector by using any monitoring system that supports HTTP requests. Monitoring the health can help to ensure that data is available on the Keystone dashboard.

By default, Keystone health services do not accept connections from any IP other than localhost. The Keystone health endpoint is `/uber/health`, and it listens on all interfaces of the Keystone Collector server on port `7777`. On query, an HTTP request status code with a JSON output is returned from the endpoint as a response, describing the status of the Keystone Collector system. 
The JSON body provides an overall health status for the `is_healthy` attribute, which is a boolean; and a detailed list of statuses per-component for the `component_details` attribute.
Here is an example:
----
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:7777/uber/health
{"is_healthy": true, "component_details": {"vicmet": "Running", "ks-collector": "Running", "ks-billing": "Running", "chronyd": "Running"}}
----
These status codes are returned:

*	*200*: indicates that all monitored components are healthy
*	*503*: indicates that one or more components are unhealthy
*	*403*: indicates that the HTTP client querying the health status is not on the _allow_ list, which is a list of allowed network CIDRs. For this status, no health information is returned.
The _allow_ list uses the network CIDR method to control which network devices are allowed to query the Keystone health system. If you receive this error, add your monitoring system to the _allow_ list from *Keystone Collector management TUI > Configure > Health Monitoring*.

[NOTE]
.Linux users, note this known issue: 
*Issue description*: Keystone Collector runs a number of containers as part of the usage metering system. When the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x server is hardened with USA Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) policies, a known issue with fapolicyd (File Access Policy Daemon) has been seen intermittently. This issue is identified as link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1907870[bug 1907870^].
*Workaround*: Until resolved by Red Hat Enterprise, NetApp recommends that you work around this issue by putting `fapolicyd` into permissive mode. In /`etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf`, set the value of `permissive = 1`.

== View system logs
You can view Keystone Collector system logs to review system information and perform troubleshooting by using those logs. Keystone Collector uses the host's _journald_ logging system, and the system logs can be reviewed through the standard _journalctl_ system utility. You can avail the following key services to examine the logs:

* ks-collector
* ks-health
* ks-autoupdate

The main data collection service _ks-collector_ produces logs in JSON format with a `run-id` attribute associated with each scheduled data collection job. The following is an example of a successful job for standard usage data collection:

== Generate and collect support bundles
The Keystone Collector TUI enables you to generate support bundles and add then to service requests for resolving support issues. Follow this procedure:

.Steps
. Start the Keystone Collector management TUI utility:
`$ keystone-collector-tui`
. Go to *Troubleshooting > Generate Support Bundle*.
image:tui-sup-bundl.png[tui screen]
. When generated, the location where the bundle is saved is displayed. Use FTP, SFTP, or SCP to connect to the location and download the log file to a local system.
image:tui-sup-bundl-2.png[tui screen]
. When the file is downloaded, you can attach it to the Keystone ServiceNow support ticket. For information about raising tickets, see link:../concepts/gssc.html[Generating service requests].
