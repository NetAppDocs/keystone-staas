.ONTAP
--
For setting up and enabling Keystone Collector in ONTAP environments, Active IQ Unified Manager (Unified Manager) should be installed with specific configurations.

Ensure that a Unified Manager server is configured where Unified Manager 9.7 or later is installed with the API Gateway functionality enabled. 

For information about installing Unified Manager, see these links:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/install-vapp/concept_requirements_for_installing_unified_manager.html[Installing Unified Manager on VMware vSphere systems^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/install-linux/concept_requirements_for_install_unified_manager.html[Installing Unified Manager on Linux systems^]

.Create Unified Manager users
You should create the following users in Unified Manager for usage and performance data collection by Keystone Collector:

* A service account for Keystone Collector with `Operator` user role. This user is required for the collection of usage data. The Keystone Collector service communicates with Unified Manager through APIs. This service account is required for the communication.
* A `Database` user account, with the `Report Schema` role. This user is required for the performance data collection.

For information about user creation, user types, and user roles, see these links:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/config/reference_definitions_of_user_types.html[Definitions of user types^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/config/reference_definitions_of_user_roles.html[Definitions of user roles^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/config/reference_unified_manager_roles_and_capabilities.html[Unified Manager user roles and capabilities^]


.Steps

. Log into the Unified Manager web UI with your application administrator user credentials. A default administrator user is created during installation. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/config/task_access_unified_manager_web_ui.html[Accessing the Unified Manager web UI^].
. Create the user with the `Operator role`. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/config/task_add_users.html[Adding users^].
. Create the `Database` user. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/config/task_create_database_user.html[Creating a database user^].

.Enable API Gateway in Unified Manager
Keystone Collector makes use of the Unified Manager API Gateway to communicate with ONTAP clusters. 

You can enable API Gateway either from the web UI, or by running a few commands through Unified Manager CLI.

|===

|*Web UI* |*CLI* 
a|
To enable API Gateway from the Unified Manager web UI, follow these steps:

. Log into the Unified Manager web UI with your application administrator user credentials. A default administrator user is created during installation. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/config/task_access_unified_manager_web_ui.html[Accessing the Unified Manager web UI^].
. For information about enabling API Gateway, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/config/concept_api_gateway.html[Enabling API Gateway^].

a|
To enable API Gateway through Unified Manager CLI, follow these steps:

. On the Unified Manager server, begin an SSH session and log into Unified Manager CLI.
`um cli login -u _<umadmin>_`
+
For information about CLI commands, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/events/reference_supported_unified_manager_cli_commands.html[Supported Unified Manager CLI commands^].
+
. Verify whether API Gateway is already enabled. 
`um option list api.gateway.enabled`
If the value returned is `true`, it indicates that the API Gateway functionality is enabled. 
. If the value returned is `false`, run this command to enable the API Gateway functionality:
`um option set api.gateway.enabled=true`
. Restart the Unified Manager server to apply the setting. For information:
* On Linux system, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/install-linux/task_restart_unified_manager.html[Restarting Unified Manager^].
* On VMware vSphere system, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq-unified-manager/install-vapp/task_restart_unified_manager_virtual_machine.html[Restarting the Unified Manager virtual machine^].

//end ONTAP, begin StorageGRID

.StorageGRID
--
There are a few configurations that are required for installing Keystone Collector on StorageGRID. 

For setting up and enabling Keystone Collector for usage metering of StorageGRID, ensure that: 

* the minimum StorageGRID version is `11.4.0`. For information about upgrade, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-116/upgrade/index.html[Upgrade StorageGRID software: Overview].
* a StorageGRID local admin user account is created for usage data collection. The Keystone Collector service communicates with the GRID through administrator node APIs. This service account is used for this communication. Follow these steps:
+
.Steps
. Log into the Grid Manager. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-116/admin/signing-in-to-grid-manager.html[Sign in to the Grid Manager].
. Create a local admin group with `Access mode: Read-only`. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-116/admin/managing-admin-groups.html#create-an-admin-group[Create an admin group].
. Add the following permissions:
**	Tenant Accounts
**	Maintenance
**	Metrics Query
. Create a Keystone service account user and associate it with the admin group. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-116/admin/managing-users.html[Manage users].
